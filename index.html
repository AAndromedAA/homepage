              <ul>

              Games
            </h3>
            <p>
              I am an avid gamer. This should come as no surprise since even sold a video game called Blastar 
              for $500 when I was merely 12 years old, and once worked at a gaming start-up called Rocket 
              Science. My favorites include Deus Ex, Fallout and BioShock.

              Parties
            </h3>
            <p>
              I also likes to throw parties. One of my previous birthdays and office celebrations have included 
              a rented castle in England where the guests played hide-and-seek and a costume party in Venice 
              where I dressed as a knight.

              Series
            </h3>
            <p>
              Also I still find time to binge-watch series on Netflix and HBO. I revealed before that I have 
              seen Silicon Valley, which centers on a fictional tech company, and Black Mirror, which explores 
              humanity‘s relationship to technology

            <h3>
              Anime
            </h3>
            <p>
              I enjoy anime and loved the Makoto Shinkai movie Your Name. I am also a fan of Studio Ghibli 
              movies like Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke. In an interview with Maureen Dowd at The New 
              York Times, I said that I spent the weekend watching anime (including Death Note and Evangelion) 
              with my girlfriend Grimes.
