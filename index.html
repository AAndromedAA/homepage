              Hello! I am Elon Musk - theTechnoking of Tesla, Imperator of Mars! I like rockets and space and want to become 
              the first human on Mars. I am a very cheerful guy and also can use drugs during interviews (remember, drugs 
              are bad and do not use them if you are not the Emperor of Mars and whole Space!).

                By the age of 12, I sold the code of a BASIC-based video game I created

                At the age of 17, in June 1989, I moved to Canada to attend Queen's University, avoiding mandatory 
                service in the South African military. My plan was to go United States where I thought great 
                things are possible, more than any other country. And it would be easy to get to the United States 
                from Canada.
